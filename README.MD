Companies House Forms Enablement Salesforce
=====================

This service serves as the front-end from Forms Enablement service for Companies House. This forms factory can dynamically build and deploy forms for the Forms Enablement service. This service works with the [Companies House Forms Enablement API Service](https://github.com/companieshouse/forms-enablement-api) to send JSON/XML to the Companies House Information Processing System (CHIPS).

### About this application

This application is written in [APEX](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/) for Salesforce. From Salesforce - "Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language that allows developers to execute flow and transaction control statements on the Force.com platform server in conjunction with calls to the Force.comâ€‹ API. Using syntax that looks like Java and acts like database stored procedures, Apex enables developers to add business logic to most system events, including button clicks, related record updates, and Visualforce pages. Apex code can be initiated by Web service requests and from triggers on objects."
